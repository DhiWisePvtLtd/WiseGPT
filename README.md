- **Choose your starting point:** Start by navigating to the screen or page where you plan to trigger the API call.
- **Select endpoints for API Integration:** Once you're at your starting point, the next step is to select the endpoint for API Integration. This step is shown once the code analysis is complete.
- **Select libraries for Code Generation:** If multiple libraries have been identified in your code, choose the ones you want WiseGPT to generate the code in.
- **Code Generation in progress:** Once the libraries are selected, the code generation process begins. Hang tight, this may take a few seconds.
- **Review and Compare code changes:** Upon completion of the code generation, you'll receive a list of files with suggested changes. Use the 'Side-by-side viewer' to compare these suggested alterations with your original code version.
- **Finalize the process:** To complete the process, accept or discard the changes. Lastly, if we've added any packages to your code, we'll give you the instructions to install them. If not, your updated code is ready to use!

## For UI code generation
A straightforward and effortless method to create UI code for your preferred screen. Simply select your desired type of screen and features, and we’ll generate code that aligns with your unique style.

## How we analyse your code
Once you grant permission, we start analyzing your code. To ensure that your code remains confidential and secure, the analysis and learning process take place locally within your development environment. The primary purpose of analyzing your code is to understand your coding style, allowing us to replicate it accurately.

## Languages and frameworks
Currently, our plugin supports React and Flutter, providing extensive capabilities in these frameworks. But we're not stopping there! We're dedicated to expanding our language support, bringing you compatibility with more programming languages in the near future.

## Privacy and data security
Protecting your privacy is our top priority. We want you to feel confident and secure. Please be assured that we neither store your code nor access any sensitive information. For more details, please refer to our Privacy Policy document.
